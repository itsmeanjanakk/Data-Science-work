This year, the 13 pro series has been elevated significantly, widening the gap between themselves and the 13, while also bringing in the much needed Pro-motion display and pro-res videos. Pick the phone up and the build quality feels absolutely amazing, deserving of an ultra premium flagship. What I also like this year is that there\\'s no feature disparity between the pro and the pro max like last year.The screen is awesome and the adaptive refresh rate makes it a way better experience than previous pros. Cameras get new lenses, and you will notice the improvement in quality in more challenging scenarios. The sierra blue looks great IMHO, and the battery life, from my limited usage, has been stellar so far.Overall, a true powerhouse that will stay strong and deliver good value for several years to come.\\n',\n",

Face unlock works with spectacles and mask on.Battery lasts roughly one day. Fast charger (bought separately) charges battery to 100% in approximately 1.5 hours. Touch is super smooth- better than iphone 12, 11 & SE. Screen is also way way better than previous iphone models.Highly secure and has many useful features like OCR (text) from photos being one of them.Pricing is very high (almost double of that of iPhone 13), probably due to being completely imported.Overall a good phone if you have the budget for it.\\n \\nAmazing battery .

Music Audi is good but up to the mark.\\n \\nwastage of money.\\n \\nDid not like\\n \\nI didn\\'t find any improvement over iPhone 12 pro. Rather clicking pic at portrait mode in 3x is a bigger headache as you can\\'t pan the zoom and 3x is too tight for indoor photography. At this price point buying a heavy weapon is not recommended\\n \\nWhen you money than this is best ... Agr nhi h toh kidney becho (dono) ...

The phone came in safe and the delivery was instant. Loved the service.\\n \\nVideo camera best in class . Cinematic mode is dslr like but only supports 1080p . Has connectivity issues with portable hotspot. Phone hangs when inside pocket , force restart only option . Video editing is fast . Camera stabilisation is excellent. Truecaller doesn‚Äôt work live, you have to open app to see who called .\\n \\nTbh yes the price is bit high, but you got the best of iphone in a compact design easy to carry around with a phenomenal 120hz display and amazing  battery life (the 2 most key factors for many) Its iphone so no complain for the camera upgraded from a Samsung Note 9 after 4 yrs shocked how much a 4yr gap can bring huge differences in Tech. Just go for it i love with my alpine green.\\n \\n1) Phone is awesome but there is some catchPrice gap between normal 13 and 13 pro is too much2) we can get offers on iPhone 13 but iPhone 13 pro models attract no offers as such normal 13 models3) camera, processor is too good üëç But why Indians price is so high as compare to other countries, just because customs and import taxes. The price gap will reduce if pro models starts to assemble in India.\\n \\nFirst of all I have not purchased it on Amazon. I\\'ve got from official store.So let\\'s discuss the phoneCAMERA- 10/10nothing to say much about iphone camera\\'s. Best photo qualityDISPLAY- 10/10Display is 120hz. People are saying it have 90 hz panel, i was like WTF.Battery- 8/10Good battery, stays a day long but can\\'t beat my old device Nokia 3310 üòÇPerformance-11/10A15 bionic is equal to ps4 pro so yeah you can expect gaming without any kind of lag or frame drop.Why to spend 40k more for this.- Firstly we get a lidar sensor which processes image better- we get more battery- we get one more camera- refresh rateEach point 10k so 10x40 = 40k üòÇüòÇ\\n \\nThe best phone by apple. perfect size and perfect fit in the hand. super fast and super good phone. must buy\\n \\nIphone is brand, but in price point we need to think twice.After after purchasing @ 1.7 lakh also Every year they are launching new mobilesNext year they ll launch 14 model nd price go down very low and every one think it\\'s oldJust see on Iphone 12 pro, last year they said it\\'s bestThis year they said it\\'s the best with very small updated software and Camara....I don\\'t have words to say...Simply if u want to show ur status then go aheadBut think....Just for show putup don\\'t go for iphone...\\n \\nI never use iPhone in my life this will be the first time for me using iPhone.. I always wanted to use iPhone but iPhone is too expensive it‚Äôs up to my budget so I always refused to buy iPhone but my husband knows that I really wanted to use iPhone so he gave me this iPhone13pro 256gb as a surprised gift..I was really happy and it makes me cried and I was so speechless that day but I never used small phone before so this IPhone13 pro is too very small for me I‚Äôm don‚Äôt blame to my husband i appreciated him coz he always wanted to make me happy but im really disappointed to iPhone company and I wanna ask question..why iPhone 13 and 13pro making in same size and why 13pro are too small like this?? Off course camera is really good I‚Äôm really happy with everything but onlyI‚Äôm really very disappointed with the size‚òπÔ∏èüò£Sorry for the bad Englishüôèüèº\\n \\nDon‚Äôt buy apple products in India, after sales services are bad, purchased #iphone13pro and it came with manufacturing defect-dust in camera lens. Service centres are not acknowledging the issue and @AppleSupport is not directly linked to these.\\n \\nLoved it overall ! The best one soo far by AppleEven the camera is superb enough to use .\\n \\nIf you are planning to buy iPhone then go for 12 or 12 pro. There is no such difference between these 2 models except the bionic chip, smaller notch and cinematic mode in pro models. For 13 and 12 only the bionic chip and the position of the camera.. no other major difference..no point of such a huge difference in price for no good difference..not a good release of Apple this year...\\n \\nGreat phone. Best features have to be the adaptive refresh rate pro-motion display and an all day long battery life.\\n \\nCamera 9.5 out of 10.Screen 10 out of 10.Speakers 9 out of 10.Build quality 10 out of 10.Performance 10 out of 10.Battery 9 out of 10.Brand value 10 out of 10.Charging speed 6 out of 10.\\n \\nUpgraded from iPhone 11 to 13 Pro and it was worth the upgrade.Its feels awesome to hold in hand and has its basics just right.\\n \\nThis is an amazing phone. It has a bigger leap in its battery life. The picture quality is awesome better than iPhone 12 Pro Max. The Cinematic mode is cool. Very happy to buy this phone. ‚ù§Ô∏è\\n \\nIf you buy this from US its worth it but from India after adding import fees it\\'s very costly. Ideal cost should be around 1 lakh only.\\n \\nBuy samsung. Not worth for  1 lakh plus .  Boycott apple products . This is a below standard phone with huge notch whereas companies like samsung are pushsing the boundaries of smartphone .\\n \\nI could have had a trip to dubai and could have hired a chopper and still could habe saved some bucks.But anyways i am with the purchase too!\\n \\nBest camera and beast processor and it is amazing phone in look also I think you have to buy it\\n \\nApple symbol is enough......and all colours are awesome.........if u can than go for it ...#love ur kidney or iphone üòÇ\\n \\nGreat purchase. Go for it without thinking twice. Best in iOS. More power and more camera quality as compared to 12 pro\\n \\nThis is incredible, just buy it better than Iphone 12 pro max...Got an amazing chip which makes the performance much better now\\n \\nHuge price but battery life is very short. 3000 mAh battery. Brick like structure. Never buy this brand. Worst experience\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Superb performance and great product assembled by apple and quality extermely amazing . Prores mode also come for iphone pro models.\\n \\nAccording to me guys.First of all I haven\\'t purchased iPhoneSecondly according to me if you have this much budget of more than 1lakhs spending on mobile is not worth at all.Infact you can invest that money on apple stock or other stock so that the money could get doubled in future bcoz buying iPhone is a depreciating assetHope you understand üôÇ\\n \\nToo much expensive.Not affordable by middle class. Only the camera position, due to this the decats were taking more than 100000 rupees\\n \\nToo costly to buy so not going to buy any time soon. It a show off phone with a heavy cost\\n \\nToo much cost. The life of a phone on an average 4 years. So why should we spend that much?\\n \\nI would never suggest anyone to buy apple phones as now there softwares and after sales has become rubbish. They don\\'t support the customers if facing any problems in there softwares and belive me they have multiple issues which they are not able to resolve them\\n \\nvery costly phone simply take s22 ultra for now having lower price and higher spec and also getting watch for just 3k\\n \\nGo with The Realme/Redmi/One plusToo much restriction...Very Bad Gaming Experience...People says I phone is Good For Gaming...But as a Gamer my View is Its Worst With low FPS restricted by Display...1.1Lac is Only For LOGO and Rest for Machine.In short Lut Gye( ÔΩ•‡∏±ÔπèÔΩ•‡∏±)\\n \\nNice phone but I don\\'t buying because very costly not allowed my pocket so change my mind for buying phone\\n \\nBekaar hai lena mat. Raddi kehte hai isko. Chinese hi kharid lo. Sasta sundar, though not tikau bas itta hi\\n \\nNo major has been done in iPhone 13.We are expecting a punch hole in iPhone 13 but same camera modeule as iPhone 12 pro\\n \\nWhy the hell there is so difference between 13 and 13 Pro? Like 13 (128gb) costs 80k and 13 Pro (128gb) directly costs 1.20L? There actually no major difference between them except the refresh rate, so for that you\\'ll charging 40k extra? First of all after so so so long you\\'ll upgrading your refresh rate from 60 to 90, infact there are phone\\'s having 144 too, but you\\'ll not letting normal people use 90 refresh rate, giving a price difference of 40k? Do you know how much that is for a common man? A person gives is years of saving to buy iPhone, and you\\'ll charge 40k extra for just a refresh rate? Apple company would earn it\\'s whole life but never die in peace, mark my words.\\n \\nIt‚Äôs a PRO in every sense.Display, cameras, A15 bionic chip, Pro motion display - the combination is deadly with great battery life. If you have iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro max, there‚Äôs no need to upgrade. But if you have older iPhones or say X or 11 also, go for this. I have upgraded from iPhone X (used that for close to 4 years now) to 13 Pro now and trust me there‚Äôs a massive difference in the performance, camera etc.And this new colour is stunning‚Ä¶Sierra Blue gonna be the fav iPhone colour this season.If budget if not an issue, then go for the Pro or Pro max model :)\\n \\nFor much too long, Apple has been shouting from the rooftops about how \"pro\" their top of the line smartphones were when they obviously lacked some very basic features and were too close for comfort to the entry level models. This year, the 13 pro series has been elevated significantly, widening the gap between themselves and the 13, while also bringing in the much needed Pro-motion display and pro-res videos. Pick the phone up and the build quality feels absolutely amazing, deserving of an ultra premium flagship. What I also like this year is that there\\'s no feature disparity between the pro and the pro max like last year.The screen is awesome and the adaptive refresh rate makes it a way better experience than previous pros. Cameras get new lenses, and you will notice the improvement in quality in more challenging scenarios. The sierra blue looks great IMHO, and the battery life, from my limited usage, has been stellar so far.Overall, a true powerhouse that will stay strong and deliver good value for several years to come.\\n \\nJust received phone an hour ago. Amazed with the build quality and features, especially improvements to the camera. Other than that phone is bit heavy and lens of device looks huge.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Have been using iPhone since decades and this is by far the best iPhone ever in terms of battery life it‚Äôs superb, the camera quality is amazing still a fingerprint magnet.Truly biggest Pro camera system upgrade ever.

       "' perhaps the best phone money can buy right now camera shots are truly awesome if you have a photographic inclination you will love it battery life is good display is buttery smooth topped of with the pro motion and latest apple chipset makes its a too good to resist phone if you have the budget this order phone video shoot time very heat best decision to buy this phone good battery life no heating issues i used to carry heavy dslr for any holiday this phone is just wow and pictures are beautiful exceptional performance i used this phone in water whole day but no impact on anything best phone ever in world premium quality phone value for money great looking fast performance best camera in the business pro nothing beats this model it s legendary meet my expectations mobile is a beast in terms of camera quality and gaming performance color is next level unique though it s a bit costly but it s worth every penny face reader is one of the best feature it read your face with mask and works amazing at night extremely happy with the product will recommend the apple online store for the purchase and parcel was hundred authentic with product completely seal packed and charge bought with it was also with it made my friends jealous as the bought the same peace even expensive at store purchased during the prime offer period and was delivered next day all smooth as expected and was a happy experience finger print reader is not provided on iphone hence the rating in that field superb phone in all aspects superb its a great iphone best phone i love this and can t keep it aside for a minute also nice buy very costly but high end built and premium feel addictive like other previous iphone models excellent triple camera with lidar face unlock works with spectacles and mask on battery lasts roughly one day fast charger bought separately charges battery to in approximately hours touch is super smooth better than iphone se screen is also way way better than previous iphone models highly secure and has many useful features like ocr text from photos being one of them pricing is very high almost double of that of iphone probably due to being completely imported overall a good phone if you have the budget for it amazing battery very cool i find it very handy for owners who are professionals very secure i will recommend it for professionals only not any kid who s gonna find that opensource kinky features of an android in this device also status symbol has nothing to fo with it you can understand this ecosystem only when you are educated and a well practicing professional with a good savings mentality nowhere i point android comparisionwith it both are best according to usage superb the media could not be loaded those who are shifting from android may find it just a normal phone but after used this device they will know the difference between iphone and android apple is a brand for reliable quality security and show off i have spent on this and i do not regret even paise of that this is ultimate and it s the best in everything be it k fps hdr recording battery life or anything else i bought this just before our vacation tour and it has been so so godly the photos and videos are out of this world it s iphone it s a apple go for it the media could not be loaded sahi h but samne dekh ke lena ek alag hi feel krata h excellent display along with a powerful camera housed smartphone perfect for macro shots and videos really very good product as a customer i am happy good phone camera of the phone is awesome and phone too is flawless look wise it s very beautiful and esp sierra blue colour is very classy mobile grip is good and it doesn t seem oversize sound quality is amazing with theatre immersive quality picture photo quality is unmatched and it s intelligent enough to clear even the shaky clicks cinematic mode videos are class apart overall great experience however face recognition is not that smooth and accurate at times it doesn t recognize unless times so this needs to be improved by apple good style video quality is non comparable heating issue my phone got wet and all box packing is very unprofessional no value for money and i absolutely dis satisfied about this product excellent amazing bettrey life and performance worth it all the time another beast the media could not be loaded apple alpine pro green would say this color alpine better then other specially if one experiences in person otherwise usual iphone progood camera screen for it promotion hzand usual iphone performance con heavy notch is deeper then previous so not exactly smaller then before it s a very powerful phone from apple everything good in this phone like battery screen camera and everything but if u already have iphone or later than i will not recommend to buy easily distinguished from other brandstoo too smooth one of the best things i have ever purchased on amazon simply awesome worth buying love it totally nyc product pros days battery life hz variable refresh rate colour accurate display best camera the best apple ecosystem sierablue colour privacy and securitycons people who love customisation might not like iphone some might feel it is overpriced but considering other flagship prices and how they have gone up in recent past this is still considerable worth phone i m a new ios user and loved to use iphone no lag ui and camera quality is awesome i have been google pixel fan and have been android user since last years i was looking for change and decided to buy iphone pro silver gb is perfect storage we can go for the screen clarity cameras features are awesome google is known for software wonders and apple for its hardware well thats true this phone is totally pro silver color gives royal look this is first time experience with iphone and it is the best one thank you amazon for this quick delivery and for the offers i have been using iphones since iphone no words to describe this phone just amazing you will get the real feel of the smoothness of pro motion display excellent night vision camera what s missed is the touch id if you are not a frequent phone changer the price point is ok very good phone only thing i didn t like is the size it is a little big to be called as a mobile phone mini s size is perfect but i bought this only for the camera and battery overall i m happy with the purchase very happy with the purchase hz brighter screen cinematic mode smaller notch improved battery life way better than iphone pro and new sierra blue colour overall it s awesome beast in performance always god apple provides the class as we all know this one got good display screen quality processor and camera i was expecting much more from battery part as i play games heavily and i am not very happy but just satisfied that apple can try to create better battery life only buy if you want to but not if you expect everything to be great edit this phone heats up after mins of heavy gaming like cod or mc i love my phone which is iphone pro sb first ever apple for me switching from redmi great size and easy for single hand operation golden colour looks classy this is the best phone money can buy bought the pro instead of the pro max coz previous device was a inch brick and feels too much heavy overheating only after minutes of using camera yesterday only i purchased the phone is there any software default or manufacturing defect great product but highly overpriced apple products are always bettee the thing about this mobile is something different it is a very awesome mobile just brought for memory but battery is useless hanging issues puwar h i love the sierra blue variant the most camera and battery life improvement is noticeable battery life better than iphone and way better than iphone se brilliant camera camera is excellent with vibrant colours excellent battery life hz screen refresh rate nice excellent phone battery life awsome best phone ever just don t think and purchase it iphone is iphone dude just love it though awesome it is battery life is average onlynotification management is worstmany utility apps not available in appstorephoto quality is bad in competitionvideo quality is goodlidar scanner is a gimmick only measure app makes use of it many videos from other phones don t run in iphone ios doesn t support codec which even k rs worth android supportscan t multi select contactscan t search recentscan t rename a photostorage management is worstoverall it s an overpriced piece of the media could not be loaded awesome the media could not be loaded amazing apple iphone pro max is best in its class best camera battery life is awesome hrs fluid os more security in os intelligent shortcuts awesome xdr screen many softwares are available free cons only weight it s a best worst phone i have ever used hangs mostly please make the product so that it is worth the price very much disappointed this phone heating as very worst and its not looks like original iphone outstanding product brilliant features always a fan of apple and this phone deserves to be given as the best phone display is excellent built quality is top notch excellent camera upgrade and battery is very good get me through the day everyday just one day of use and the display stop responding went to apple support centre they sent that to banagalore for display change you don t expect something like this when you pay such a high price for a phone highly disappointed the media could not be loaded west great phone best in class i switched from android to ios so found ios a little bit boring as it doesn t provide much customisation options but the camera module is fantastic and makes it a great phone however the price is also a bit high and you can buy good phones in under k if you like android but if you like to spend you can surely buy this waste soo expensive for this configurationnever buy this bricknot that much value of this productplease don t waste your money sold my one kidney to get this premium i phone and i think battery life is more than my life i have shifted from pro to just becoz of weight pro use to feel lyk a brick in my pocket propros best camera there is no competition calling audio quality is also best touch sensitive is very nice buy from dubai it will cost kcons battery life is bad high cost if buying from india cost is lacs music audi is good but up to the mark wastage of money did not like i didn t find any improvement over iphone pro rather clicking pic at portrait mode in x is a bigger headache as you can t pan the zoom and x is too tight for indoor photography at this price point buying a heavy weapon is not recommended when you money than this is best agr nhi h toh kidney becho dono best toh yhi h camera and battery life charming and phone model very good all time phone good world most sharp click photo graphy this is one of my best purchases on amazon the phone came in safe and the delivery was instant loved the service video camera best in class cinematic mode is dslr like but only supports p has connectivity issues with portable hotspot phone hangs when inside pocket force restart only option video editing is fast camera stabilisation is excellent truecaller doesn t work live you have to open app to see who called tbh yes the price is bit high but you got the best of iphone in a compact design easy to carry around with a phenomenal hz display and amazing battery life the most key factors for many its iphone so no complain for the camera upgraded from a samsung note after yrs shocked how much a yr gap can bring huge differences in tech just go for it i love with my alpine green phone is awesome but there is some catchprice gap between normal and pro is too much we can get offers on iphone but iphone pro models attract no offers as such normal models camera processor is too good but why indians price is so high as compare to other countries just because customs and import taxes the price gap will reduce if pro models starts to assemble in india first of all i have not purchased it on amazon i ve got from official store so let s discuss the phonecamera nothing to say much about iphone camera s best photo qualitydisplay display is hz people are saying it have hz panel i was like wtf battery good battery stays a day long but can t beat my old device nokia performance a bionic is equal to ps pro so yeah you can expect gaming without any kind of lag or frame drop why to spend k more for this firstly we get a lidar sensor which processes image better we get more battery we get one more camera refresh rateeach point k so x k the best phone by apple perfect size and perfect fit in the hand super fast and super good phone must buy iphone is brand but in price point we need to think twice after after purchasing lakh also every year they are launching new mobilesnext year they ll launch model nd price go down very low and every one think it s oldjust see on iphone pro last year they said it s bestthis year they said it s the best with very small updated software and camara i don t have words to say simply if u want to show ur status then go aheadbut think just for show putup don t go for iphone i never use iphone in my life this will be the first time for me using iphone i always wanted to use iphone but iphone is too expensive it s up to my budget so i always refused to buy iphone but my husband knows that i really wanted to use iphone so he gave me this iphone pro gb as a surprised gift i was really happy and it makes me cried and i was so speechless that day but i never used small phone before so this iphone pro is too very small for me i m don t blame to my husband i appreciated him coz he always wanted to make me happy but im really disappointed to iphone company and i wanna ask question why iphone and pro making in same size and why pro are too small like this off course camera is really good i m really happy with everything but onlyi m really very disappointed with the size sorry for the bad english don t buy apple products in india after sales services are bad purchased iphone pro and it came with manufacturing defect dust in camera lens service centres are not acknowledging the issue and applesupport is not directly linked to these loved it overall the best one soo far by appleeven the camera is superb enough to use if you are planning to buy iphone then go for or pro there is no such difference between these models except the bionic chip smaller notch and cinematic mode in pro models for and only the bionic chip and the position of the camera no other major difference no point of such a huge difference in price for no good difference not a good release of apple this year great phone best features have to be the adaptive refresh rate pro motion display and an all day long battery life camera out of screen out of speakers out of build quality out of performance out of battery out of brand value out of charging speed out of upgraded from iphone to pro and it was worth the upgrade its feels awesome to hold in hand and has its basics just right this is an amazing phone it has a bigger leap in its battery life the picture quality is awesome better than iphone pro max the cinematic mode is cool very happy to buy this phone if you buy this from us its worth it but from india after adding import fees it s very costly ideal cost should be around lakh only buy samsung not worth for lakh plus boycott apple products this is a below standard phone with huge notch whereas companies like samsung are pushsing the boundaries of smartphone i could have had a trip to dubai and could have hired a chopper and still could habe saved some bucks but anyways i am with the purchase too best camera and beast processor and it is amazing phone in look also i think you have to buy it apple symbol is enough and all colours are awesome if u can than go for it love ur kidney or iphone great purchase go for it without thinking twice best in ios more power and more camera quality as compared to pro this is incredible just buy it better than iphone pro max got an amazing chip which makes the performance much better now huge price but battery life is very short mah battery brick like structure never buy this brand worst experience the media could not be loaded superb performance and great product assembled by apple and quality extermely amazing prores mode also come for iphone pro models according to me guys first of all i haven t purchased iphonesecondly according to me if you have this much budget of more than lakhs spending on mobile is not worth at all infact you can invest that money on apple stock or other stock so that the money could get doubled in future bcoz buying iphone is a depreciating assethope you understand too much expensive not affordable by middle class only the camera position due to this the decats were taking more than rupees too costly to buy so not going to buy any time soon it a show off phone with a heavy cost too much cost the life of a phone on an average years so why should we spend that much i would never suggest anyone to buy apple phones as now there softwares and after sales has become rubbish they don t support the customers if facing any problems in there softwares and belive me they have multiple issues which they are not able to resolve them very costly phone simply take s ultra for now having lower price and higher spec and also getting watch for just k go with the realme redmi one plustoo much restriction very bad gaming experience people says i phone is good for gaming but as a gamer my view is its worst with low fps restricted by display lac is only for logo and rest for machine in short lut gye nice phone but i don t buying because very costly not allowed my pocket so change my mind for buying phone bekaar hai lena mat raddi kehte hai isko chinese hi kharid lo sasta sundar though not tikau bas itta hi no major has been done in iphone we are expecting a punch hole in iphone but same camera modeule as iphone pro why the hell there is so difference between and pro like gb costs k and pro gb directly costs l there actually no major difference between them except the refresh rate so for that you ll charging k extra first of all after so so so long you ll upgrading your refresh rate from to infact there are phone s having too but you ll not letting normal people use refresh rate giving a price difference of k do you know how much that is for a common man a person gives is years of saving to buy iphone and you ll charge k extra for just a refresh rate apple company would earn it s whole life but never die in peace mark my words it s a pro in every sense display cameras a bionic chip pro motion display the combination is deadly with great battery life if you have iphone pro or pro max there s no need to upgrade but if you have older iphones or say x or also go for this i have upgraded from iphone x used that for close to years now to pro now and trust me there s a massive difference in the performance camera etc and this new colour is stunning sierra blue gonna be the fav iphone colour this season if budget if not an issue then go for the pro or pro max model for much too long apple has been shouting from the rooftops about how pro their top of the line smartphones were when they obviously lacked some very basic features and were too close for comfort to the entry level models this year the pro series has been elevated significantly widening the gap between themselves and the while also bringing in the much needed pro motion display and pro res videos pick the phone up and the build quality feels absolutely amazing deserving of an ultra premium flagship what i also like this year is that there s no feature disparity between the pro and the pro max like last year the screen is awesome and the adaptive refresh rate makes it a way better experience than previous pros cameras get new lenses and you will notice the improvement in quality in more challenging scenarios the sierra blue looks great imho and the battery life from my limited usage has been stellar so far overall a true powerhouse that will stay strong and deliver good value for several years to come just received phone an hour ago amazed with the build quality and features especially improvements to the camera other than that phone is bit heavy and lens of device looks huge the media could not be loaded have been using iphone since decades and this is by far the best iphone ever in terms of battery life it s superb the camera quality is amazing still a fingerprint magnet truly biggest pro camera system upgrade ever super retina xdr display with promotion is a different feel altogether cinematic mode is one brilliant addition and shifts focus automatically in your videos macro photography is goodmust say it s worth it switched from s ultra and it is worth it my second apple device after s feels premium and feature rich the pro motion is way better than the hz in the s ultra plus no heating issue which i was facing in the former only downside is it has a heft to it highly recommended device great camera huge battery and amazing video clarityafter sharing the photos got a comment from a friend is that clicked on professional camera the product is greatmy only complaint is about how it was delivered it was sent with zero protection layers no bubble wrap or foam it was simply a box wrapped over a box i got lucky that phone wasn t damaged in the transit beautiful camera beautiful proformance beautiful display just go for it it gives a premium feeling just when you hold it i just love the design it s stunning fine i like this more storage it s good more storage this good phone apple create a best phone all is good for the phone next level experience i have no words for this phone i am speechless but its very expensive thks the biggest issues starts when u buy iphone and the phone cries for getting signal for you if don t trust buy iphone and experience it the phone is very balanced and heavy feel perfect camera and worth every penny the display is the most smooth and quick responsive excellent iphone and camera size is very bigdisplay is excellent camera surface slso got lower than pro and max the media could not be loaded i am hoping ios is bringing good updates in the future good camera and battery life will recommend to go for iphone not much difference this apple pro is one of the phones which combines all the features in one compact form factor not too big perfect size with all those pro features like pro motion display and pro res sadly this gb version can t shoot k pro res anyway that s heavy format which most of them not gonna use it exciting camera upgrade from previous version and most importantly battery upgrade from previous year is the best thing with all improvements this going to be best phone of the year original product not to worry apple made package so small i was shocked my plus iphone box was double the size of pro box its very good best seller i purchased one for me and one for my mother she was very happy i love it the camera quality is very fantastic overall performance is very fast battery life could be improved for heavy usage supercool design and color purchased from apple store trust me it perfectly justifies the amount you pay everything is so perfect no scope for any kind of complaint if you re confused between gold and blue go for blue without any hesitation wonderful phone it s new look omg but i can buy it please someone gift me this please i will be grateful '"
